# CommandManager
Basically a GUI for Batch-Scripts

## Idea :bulb: 
Using different batch files can get messy especially when storing them in different folders and locations.
This application provides more organisation with visual appeal.

## Usage :wrench:

Simply download the .exe file [here](https://github.com/Rhatalin/CommandManager/releases) and open it.
I would recommend placing the application in a folder (e.g. "C:\Program Files\CommandManager"
and creating a shortcut in your Windows start menu.

## Demo :desktop_computer:

This is how the Command Manager looks for now:
