# Command Manager ![CommandManagerLogo](https://github.com/Rhatalin/CommandManager/blob/master/CommandManager/Images/Logo_CommandManager_Violet.ico) 
Basically a GUI for Batch-Scripts

## Idea :bulb: 
Using different batch files can get messy especially when storing them in different folders and locations.
This application provides more organisation with visual appeal.

## Usage :wrench:

Simply download the [executable](https://github.com/Rhatalin/CommandManager/releases). No installation needed.

## Demo :desktop_computer:

This is how the Command Manager looks for now:
